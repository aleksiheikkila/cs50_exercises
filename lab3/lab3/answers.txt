sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: It's the fastest for the sorted arrays.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It's clearly the fastest for the large random list of numbers. It's O(nlogn) vs O(n^2) for the other algos.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Faster than bubble sort for the reversed array (less swapping to do)
